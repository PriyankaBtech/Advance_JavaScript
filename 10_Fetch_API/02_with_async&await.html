        getQuotes() // Promise

        // getQuotes() function is defined as an asynchronous function, which means it uses the await keyword to wait for a Promise to resolve before continuing with the next line of code. Within the function, the fetch() method is used to make a request to the API, and the response is saved to the response variable using the await keyword.

        // Then, the response is parsed as JSON using the response.json() method and saved to the data variable using the await keyword. Finally, the resulting data is logged to the console using console.log().
